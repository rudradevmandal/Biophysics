# Similation models for Theoretical Biophysics
## 1. Michaelis–Menten kinetics
This equation is called the Michaelis–Menten equation. Here, $V_{max}$ represents the maximum rate achieved by the system, happening at saturating substrate concentration for a given enzyme concentration. When the value of the Michaelis constant $K_{M}$ is numerically equal to the substrate concentration, then the reaction rate is half of $V_{max}$. Biochemical reactions involving a single substrate are often assumed to follow Michaelis–Menten kinetics, without regard to the model's underlying assumptions.
$$v=\frac{d[P]}{dt}=V_{\max }\frac{[S]}{K_M + [S]}$$

## 2. Potential Well
A potential well is the region surrounding a local minimum of potential energy. Energy captured in a potential well is unable to convert to another type of energy (kinetic energy in the case of a gravitational potential well) because it is captured in the local minimum of a potential well. Therefore, a body may not proceed to the global minimum of potential energy, as it would naturally tend to do due to entropy.

## 3. Self-avoiding Random Walk
This is a sequence of moves on a lattice (a lattice path) that does not visit the same point more than once. This play a central role in the modeling of the topological and knot-theoretic behavior of thread- and loop-like molecules such as proteins.
